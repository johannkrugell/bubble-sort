# Overview
A bubble sort program written as part of the Odin Project Fullstack developer
course. The program sorts a group of items in an array, each element is compared 
to the next element. The elements are swapped if the one on the left is larger 
than the one on the right. This continues for the length of the array to the 
power of 2. Until the array is eventually sorted.
